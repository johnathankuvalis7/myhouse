                 Offers from ibuyers like offerpad and opendoor are aggressive (from time to time just 1–2% lower than open market offers), but they’re available only in select major metros.  Offers from “we buy houses” agencies are always low (as low as 50% of the house’s resale value).  Take a hybrid strategy using a home trade-in provider.  Generally, the most direct path to a fast home sale is thru an ibuyer or company that buys houses for cash.  Cash buyer businesses , which also are from time to time called house flippers, purchase homes in just about any condition and might often close in under two weeks.  But additionally they pay the least amount of cash — once in a while as little as 50% of the home's after repair (or resale) value. Some cash home buyers will make a suggestion with out seeing your house first.  Don’t be stunned when these other home-buying businesses hit you with hidden fees.  We, on the other hand, always make the effort up front to do an in-person session at your home.  You wouldn’t buy a home sight unseen, and neither would we.  With us, that you could sell homes for cash.
