             Offers from ibuyers like offerpad and opendoor are aggressive (from time to time just 1–2% under open market offers), but they’re available only in select major metros.  Offers from “we buy houses” agencies are always low (as low as 50% of the home’s resale value).  Take a hybrid method using a home trade-in carrier.  Generally, the most direct path to a fast home sale is thru an ibuyer or company that buys houses for cash.  Cash buyer businesses , which also are now and again called house flippers, acquire homes in just about any condition and might often close in under two weeks.  But in addition they pay the least amount of money — on occasion as little as 50% of the home's after repair (or resale) value.
