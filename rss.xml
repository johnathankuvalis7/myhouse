<description>But there’s a catch: these house buying businesses don’t pay top dollar for houses.  Offers from ibuyers like offerpad and opendoor are competitive (on occasion just 1–2% lower than open market offers), but they’re available only in select major metros.  Offers from “we buy houses” companies are always low (as low as 50% of the home’s resale value). Take a hybrid method using a home trade-in provider.  Generally, the most direct route to a fast home sale is through an ibuyer or company that buys houses for cash.  Cash buyer businesses , which also are infrequently called house flippers, purchase homes in pretty much any situation and can often close in under two weeks. </description>
